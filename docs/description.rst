Sorotraj allows you to generate trajectory functionsto control soft robots.
Trajectories are defined in a simple, human-readable yaml file, and are designed
for compatibillity with both with `Ctrl-P pressure controllers <https://github.com/cbteeple/ctrlp>`_ (for real-world soft robots)
and `SoMo simulations <https://github.com/GrauleM/somo>`_ (for virtual soft robots).
